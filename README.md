# Car-features-analysis
This project investigates automotive market data to analyze pricing dynamics, 
performance factors, and design an interactive Excel dashboard that reveals how car 
features affect MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price). 
Business Problem: 
“What features most significantly influence car pricing, and how do brand, 
performance, and vehicle type interact in determining value?” 
The goal is to empower analysts, dealerships, and auto manufacturers with a self
service dashboard to guide decisions on pricing, inventory, and marketing.
